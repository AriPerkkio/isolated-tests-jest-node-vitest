# Test runners with test isolation

- Typescript
- Single source file
- 1000 tests
- Biased conditions only, make sure you know how each test runner works internally ðŸ˜‡
- Test isolation
- Cold runs only
- Preparation command before each run: `rm -rf node_modules/; pnpm i`
- In real world projects these results don't matter much.

Run with:

```sh
$ rm -rf node_modules
$ pnpm install
$ time pnpm run <command>
```

| Test runner | Time    | Runtime version |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `jest`      | 22.114s | Node `v22.16.0` |
| `vitest`    | 7.639s  | Node `v22.16.0` |
| `rstest`    | 15.704s | Node `v22.16.0` |
| `node:test` | 14.938s | Node `v22.16.0` |
| `deno test` | 8.592s  | Deno `v2.3.6`   |

Bun, Mocha and similar non-isolated test runners fail these test cases:

```sh
# No isolation available, same with Mocha
$ bun test ./jest/**

...

jest/example-696.test.ts:
1 | export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
2 |   if (globalThis.CHECK_IF_ISOLATED) {
3 |     throw new Error("Test case was not isolated");
              ^
